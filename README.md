# Creating a E-Commerce website using MERN Stack

This mainly i am following a tutorial from youtube on the same, but there are some differences and i am going to do some amount of improvements to it.

This is mainly following the steps and coding along, so there will be little to no code matching.


## main goal
-> able to build all the functionality shown in the tutorial 
-> do react testing 
-> use MUI components
-> should be able to do integrate with backend


In this I should be consistant throughout and thinking to complete in 2 weeks as I am working in a 8-hours internship and this is a full stack application after a long time
